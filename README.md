##Discussion

The first thing I note is that there are at least four active domains
here: 
* **Authentication**
	
  Any time you see "As a XXX", "sign in", etc you're dealing with this one. 

* **Authorization**

  Also implied by "As a XXX"â€”the role of the user matters

* **Inventory**

  Order taking systems will generally have an inventory associated with them

* **Orders**

  Customer order tracking
